# CS302: Implementation of Programming Languages

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- DFA construction and scanning
- SLR, CLR, LALR parsing
- Syntax-directed translation and semantic actions
- Symbol table construction and scope handling
- Runtime environment design
- Instruction selection and register allocation

## 🔧 Lab Project (CS316)

Implementation of a subset of the C language as a compiler project.

### SCLP Compiler | Spring 2024

- Developed a compiler for **SCLP**, a C-language subset supporting recursion, pointers, arrays, and control structures.
- Used **Lex** for lexical analysis and **Yacc** for parsing.
- Performed lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis including type checking and scope analysis.
- Constructed intermediate representations: AST, Three-Address Code (TAC), and Register Transfer Language (RTL).
- Generated 32-bit x86 assembly code with **register allocation** and **basic optimizations**.
- Applied **Sethi-Ullman algorithm** to improve register usage and overall performance.
